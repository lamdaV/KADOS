kernel.c
==============
- The `kernel.c` file makes an interrupt (interrupt 0x21) and starts our shell in its own process.
- It can run up to `8` process at a time through a scheduler using round robin
- It also defines such functions as `printString()`, `readString()`, `mod()`, `div()`, `readSector()`, and other utilities.

shell.c
==============
- The `shell.c` file loops infinitely, using interrupts to print a shell prompt and accepts string input.
- If the string input is a valid command (currently in the form of `type <filename>` or `execute <filename>`) it makes an interrupt and performs the appropriate function on the file specified by `filename` in a new process.
- We have added the following special features to our shell:
  - you can change the background color of the terminal with `bgcolor` then a color (`black`, `blue`, `cyan`, `red`, `purple`, `gray`, `lime`, `teal`, or `orange`). At startup, it is defaulted to black.
    - **WARNING:** SETTING COLOR TO GRAY IS NOT ADVISED SINCE THE TEXT IS GRAY
  - you can clear the terminal screen by typing `clear`
  - you can enter `ps` to display the pids that are currently active
  - when you perform a `dir` the shell prints out the names of all programs in the directory as well as the amount of sectors they each take up with column labels

Testing
==============
- Verification that our OS works so far is done by running from our Makefile (`make run`). Test commands can be run from the terminal.
- For example, typing the command `type messag` into our shell loads the `messag` file and prints it.
- Typing the command `execute tstpr` loads the `tstpr2` (`tstprg` will hang) program onto shell's location on the disk and runs it. It should print a message and return to the shell.
